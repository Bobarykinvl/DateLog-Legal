  <strong>Terms &amp; Conditions</strong><br>
  <p>
    These terms and conditions apply to the DateLog app (hereafter referred to as the "Application") for mobile devices. The Application is published under the Apple Developer Program by Raman Pazdniakou and developed by Vladislav Bobarykin as a commercial service.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p>
    By downloading or using the Application, you agree to comply with and be bound by these terms. Unauthorized copying, modifying, reverse engineering, or redistributing the Application or any of its parts is strictly prohibited. All trademarks, copyrights, and intellectual property rights related to the Application remain with the publisher and developer.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p>
    The Application stores and processes the data you provide in order to function properly. It is your responsibility to ensure the security of your device and your access credentials. Jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which removes software restrictions and may compromise your device, is strongly discouraged.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p>
    The Application may use third-party services that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are links to the Terms of some of these providers:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.google.com/analytics/terms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Analytics for Firebase</a></li>
  </ul>

  <br>
  <p>
    Please note: some functions of the Application require an active internet connection. The Application cannot be held responsible if certain features do not function due to lack of connectivity or data limits. Any mobile data charges are your responsibility.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p>
    It is also your responsibility to ensure that your device is charged and functioning. If your device fails and you are unable to access the Application, we are not liable for any resulting issues or data loss.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p>
    While the developer aims to ensure the Application is accurate and up-to-date, information provided may depend on third parties. We assume no liability for losses caused by relying on information within the Application.
  </p>

  <br>
  <p>
    The Application may be updated or discontinued at any time. You agree to accept all future updates as part of continued usage. Should the Application be terminated, you must stop using it and remove it from your device.
  </p>
